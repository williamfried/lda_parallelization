My main contributions were:
1. serial implementation of collapsed Gibbs sampling (see serial_cgs_driver.py and serial_cgs.py)
2. parallelized implementation of collapsed Gibbs sampling using MPI (see archive/mpi_implementation_asynchronous.py and archive/mpi_implementation_synchronous.py)
3. Wrote entire description of algorithm in writeup on webiste
